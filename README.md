# CS1400---Text_File_Encryption_Decryption

This program performs a simple encryption / decryption algorithm on a given text file. The excrypted / decrypted text is then output to a new text file called either Encryption.txt or Decryption.txt. The process for encrypting involves incrementing the ascii value for letter characters before outputting to the new text file, and vice versa for the decryption process. Numbers are left as they are.
